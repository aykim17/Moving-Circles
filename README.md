# Moving-Circles
Create a moving circles screensaver.  Originally started as Lab for C212.

Simply press 'c' to add a moving circle to the frame.
Press 'r' to add a rectangle.
Press 's' to add a square.
Press the spacebar to pause/start the circle movement.
Press ESC to clear the screen and reset the shape speed

## ToDo
- ~Allow user to change frame size, and have circles adjust~
- ~Allow user to change background color~
- ~Allow user to pause~
- ~Allow user to clear the screen~
- ~Add in new shapes~
- ~Fix intersection bug~ Not perfect, but much improved.
